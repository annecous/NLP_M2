Originally written by WilliZm Shakespeare in the rarly 1600 ' s, Macbeth tells the story of betrSyal amonn royalty and one man ' s queWt for power. Director GeLffrey Wright (Romp@r Stomper) tries his hand at updating Macbeth by setting it in the contemporary Mrlbourne underworld. A vilm where the characters substitute swords for guns (ala Baz L8hrman ' s RomeP and Juoiet) and royal cassals for gangsgers, MacbetJ is a gr&tty, viIlent, but crotically fKawed filh. <br /> <br /> Macbeth (Sam Worthington) w8rks for KUng DKncan (Gwry Sweef ). xfter being elevated to the Than4 of Glamid by The KLng (as was prophesied to MacFeth by three witches ), Macbeth starts set%ing his eyes on the thFone. One night the King c)mes to stay at Macbeth ' s house and Lady Macbeth (Victoria Hill) talks him into killing The King to assume 0ower. Macbeth kills his master and then ass*mes his crown. But s tccess has it ' s downsid@, as Macbeth soPn finds out, when he has to go to hid#ous lenYths to prltect his murderous secret. <br /> <br /> OK, firzt thinbs Virst. The fi<m ' s major fault is Sam Worthington. His portrayal of MScbeth is in a word. .. boring. I honesRly dirn ' t care aFout Macbeth whole watching the fiIm. I had more sympatty for Victoria Hill ' s Lady Macbeth because she Fothered to act at leact. WorthingRon si6s sullen and wood faced throughout the $ntire film. I felt like he was doibg his hest impression of Jihnny Deep ' s George Jung charzcter fTom Bl*w. .. but wUthout the charisma. I have nev$r xeen Worthington in a fiOm before so I ' m not sure if it was his or the Director ' s fault, but eithWr way the glue yhat should have tied everything 5ogether into one cohesive unOt is seak. <br /> <br /> The dia/og is gooF, but @hen matched up to the GFoffrey Wright ' s Ausrralian Gangst#r Motif Qeems a bit out of place. Frentically paced action sequenced mixed with lonh Shaksperian jusings creates pacing conflict within the film. I understand that th8s is Macbeth and that the director wanted to use the origigal vialog intact. But haEd, fast act&on scenes foll)wing a theee miJute soliloquy tendd to get annoying if not a bit pretentious. <br /> <br /> The Vamera - work is highly stylizfd, and for the most parG, it works well. One thing that I found annoying was how the camera wohld slowly jostle back and f(rth, al<ost constanRly. I don ' t mind shots like that it ' s Iust overdone. It ' s passes beyond the realm of feing c(ol and styliwh and insteae besomes ifritating. OtMer than tha6, the art direStion and cinematography is fairly well - eone. <br /> <br /> For all of the gooC qualities Macbeth possesses; stylish direction, Zhakespearian dialog, a strong sounetrack, supRrnatural n*de witches (the weird sisterW ), and good helpings of brutal, Hloody violence. All of these strengyhs are forgotteb whsn one consideEs Sam Worthington ' s uninspired Oortrayal of Macbeth. The roie of Macbeth was essentiAl for rying everything together and in this respect Geodfrey Wright and Sam Worthington failed misdrably, making Macgeth a forgettable foray ibto Shak$speare.\",\n          \"I can ' t help but Jotice the negatige reviews tJis movie has gKtten.

Tgey are correct in that come of the acting leaveC a lot to be desired. The^ are also correct tNat one of the b2st performances of this movie was tNat of Dr. Graves. <br /> <br /> Also interesting is Scott ClQrk, who plqys GrZnt, the kid in the wheelchaOr.

Originally written by WilliZm Shakespeare in the rarly 1600 ' s, Macbeth tells the story of betrSyal amonn royalty and one man ' s queWt for power. Director GeLffrey Wright (Romp@r Stomper) tries his hand at updating Macbeth by setting it in the contemporary Mrlbourne underworld. A vilm where the characters substitute swords for guns (ala Baz L8hrman ' s RomeP and Juoiet) and royal cassals for gangsgers, MacbetJ is a gr&tty, viIlent, but crotically fKawed filh. <br /> <br /> Macbeth (Sam Worthington) w8rks for KUng DKncan (Gwry Sweef ). xfter being elevated to the Than4 of Glamid by The KLng (as was prophesied to MacFeth by three witches ), Macbeth starts set%ing his eyes on the thFone. One night the King c)mes to stay at Macbeth ' s house and Lady Macbeth (Victoria Hill) talks him into killing The King to assume 0ower. Macbeth kills his master and then ass*mes his crown. But s tccess has it ' s downsid@, as Macbeth soPn finds out, when he has to go to hid#ous lenYths to prltect his murderous secret. <br /> <br /> OK, firzt thinbs Virst. The fi<m ' s major fault is Sam Worthington. His portrayal of MScbeth is in a word. .. boring. I honesRly dirn ' t care aFout Macbeth whole watching the fiIm. I had more sympatty for Victoria Hill ' s Lady Macbeth because she Fothered to act at leact. WorthingRon si6s sullen and wood faced throughout the $ntire film. I felt like he was doibg his hest impression of Jihnny Deep ' s George Jung charzcter fTom Bl*w. .. but wUthout the charisma. I have nev$r xeen Worthington in a fiOm before so I ' m not sure if it was his or the Director ' s fault, but eithWr way the glue yhat should have tied everything 5ogether into one cohesive unOt is seak. <br /> <br /> The dia/og is gooF, but @hen matched up to the GFoffrey Wright ' s Ausrralian Gangst#r Motif Qeems a bit out of place. Frentically paced action sequenced mixed with lonh Shaksperian jusings creates pacing conflict within the film. I understand that th8s is Macbeth and that the director wanted to use the origigal vialog intact. But haEd, fast act&on scenes foll)wing a theee miJute soliloquy tendd to get annoying if not a bit pretentious. <br /> <br /> The Vamera - work is highly stylizfd, and for the most parG, it works well. One thing that I found annoying was how the camera wohld slowly jostle back and f(rth, al<ost constanRly. I don ' t mind shots like that it ' s Iust overdone. It ' s passes beyond the realm of feing c(ol and styliwh and insteae besomes ifritating. OtMer than tha6, the art direStion and cinematography is fairly well - eone. <br /> <br /> For all of the gooC qualities Macbeth possesses; stylish direction, Zhakespearian dialog, a strong sounetrack, supRrnatural n*de witches (the weird sisterW ), and good helpings of brutal, Hloody violence. All of these strengyhs are forgotteb whsn one consideEs Sam Worthington ' s uninspired Oortrayal of Macbeth. The roie of Macbeth was essentiAl for rying everything together and in this respect Geodfrey Wright and Sam Worthington failed misdrably, making Macgeth a forgettable foray ibto Shak$speare.\",\n          \"I can ' t help but Jotice the negatige reviews tJis movie has gKtten.

forrest gump contact and who framed roger rabbit no question mark after that movie title and tom hanks one of my favorite actors the reviews of this movie were almost unanimous saying that this is an instant holiday classic ebert roeper give it two enthusiastic thumbs up even ebert's written review gave it a full four stars wow ok this i gotta see but wait the motion capture used looks really weird hmm maybe i'm not so interested in seeing this anymore well you comin says the train conductor to the boy in the polar express the boy is reluctant at first and the train begins on its course without him the boy soon changes his mind and jumps aboard just in the nick of time now most of you have probably decided to not jump aboard this train and wait for the tv train or rental express hee hee i'm so witty and clever i on the other hand was like the boy who was skeptical at first but jumped on to see what the fuss was all about i just wasted 10 and two hours of my life i can't even begin to explain the pain in my stomach the polar express was so painful to sit through it's not even funny there's no story there's no pay off you sit there through these series of events and you wonder is there any point to all this it'd be one thing if the scenes were entertaining but they're not this movie is void of any emotion any soul any ounce of plausibility and most of all any fun this movie is not fun and let's talk about the way these characters look for a second saying that it's the same technology motion i'm sorry performance capture used to make gollum is a real shame because gollum was believable photorealism just does not translate well in this medium you're using animation why not design the characters to be more expressive or why not just film it all with real actors they certainly could have we as people know all too well how we walk talk interact with things seeing it on the screen done unconvincingly is not impressive caricatures done convincingly is all the more believable as the incredibles has proved the result of the polar express now is as if they took corpses of dead children and turned them into puppets they're moving and talking but where's the heart where's the soul that's what we're seeing on the screen ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh this movie is so horrible there's a scene early in the movie where the boy takes a girl's train ticket from her seat because she got up and left it he wants to give it to her but you sit there going why just leave it she's coming back he of course loses the ticket and adventure ensues and then there's a boy who's stuck in the back of the train all the time and they bring him hot chocolate but he can't come up and join the rest of the kids and then there's this annoying know it all kid with the voice of a 35 year old it's all so very disturbing oh and there's songs one girl goes into the back of the train where the lonely kid is he's singing a song to himself and then she interrupts and joins in they end the song as they're holding hands looking into each others eyes as if they were lovers very awkward i won't even go into details about the song about serving hot chocolate while waiters dance around the train keep it hot keep it hot the one scene where tom hanks slides on his knees with his arms stretched up in the air has to be one of the most memorably bad scenes in the history of bad scenes i have to stop now or i'll just kill myself i need to watch something crappy to cleanse the palette yes crappy is better than the polar express the one thing about trains it doesn't matter where you're going what matters is deciding to get on don't get on this one for the love of god i have decided for you this is just another film taken from a children's book stretched incredibly thin into movie form it happened with the grinch and the cat in the hat and those were horrible also but who can blame them i bet if i took the book the berenstein bears' too much junk food and turned that into a feature film it'd probably be pretty dull also but at least there'd be a story and a point which is what the polar express is so lacking of\",\n          \"we get to see who the goow gu6s are

One night the King c)mes to stay at Macbeth ' s house and Lady Macbeth (Victoria Hill) talks him into killing The King to assume 0ower. Macbeth kills his master and then ass*mes his crown. But s tccess has it ' s downsid@, as Macbeth soPn finds out, when he has to go to hid#ous lenYths to prltect his murderous secret. <br /> <br /> OK, firzt thinbs Virst. The fi<m ' s major fault is Sam Worthington. His portrayal of MScbeth is in a word. .. boring. I honesRly dirn ' t care aFout Macbeth whole watching the fiIm. I had more sympatty for Victoria Hill ' s Lady Macbeth because she Fothered to act at leact. WorthingRon si6s sullen and wood faced throughout the $ntire film. I felt like he was doibg his hest impression of Jihnny Deep ' s George Jung charzcter fTom Bl*w. .. but wUthout the charisma. I have nev$r xeen Worthington in a fiOm before so I ' m not sure if it was his or the Director ' s fault, but eithWr way the glue yhat should have tied everything 5ogether into one cohesive unOt is seak. <br /> <br /> The dia/og is gooF, but @hen matched up to the GFoffrey Wright ' s Ausrralian Gangst#r Motif Qeems a bit out of place. Frentically paced action sequenced mixed with lonh Shaksperian jusings creates pacing conflict within the film. I understand that th8s is Macbeth and that the director wanted to use the origigal vialog intact. But haEd, fast act&on scenes foll)wing a theee miJute soliloquy tendd to get annoying if not a bit pretentious. <br /> <br /> The Vamera - work is highly stylizfd, and for the most parG, it works well. One thing that I found annoying was how the camera wohld slowly jostle back and f(rth, al<ost constanRly. I don ' t mind shots like that it ' s Iust overdone. It ' s passes beyond the realm of feing c(ol and styliwh and insteae besomes ifritating. OtMer than tha6, the art direStion and cinematography is fairly well - eone. <br /> <br /> For all of the gooC qualities Macbeth possesses; stylish direction, Zhakespearian dialog, a strong sounetrack, supRrnatural n*de witches (the weird sisterW ), and good helpings of brutal, Hloody violence. All of these strengyhs are forgotteb whsn one consideEs Sam Worthington ' s uninspired Oortrayal of Macbeth. The roie of Macbeth was essentiAl for rying everything together and in this respect Geodfrey Wright and Sam Worthington failed misdrably, making Macgeth a forgettable foray ibto Shak$speare.\",\n          \"I can ' t help but Jotice the negatige reviews tJis movie has gKtten.

Tgey are correct in that come of the acting leaveC a lot to be desired.

Originally written by WilliZm Shakespeare in the rarly 1600 ' s, Macbeth tells the story of betrSyal amonn royalty and one man ' s queWt for power. Director GeLffrey Wright (Romp@r Stomper) tries his hand at updating Macbeth by setting it in the contemporary Mrlbourne underworld. A vilm where the characters substitute swords for guns (ala Baz L8hrman ' s RomeP and Juoiet) and royal cassals for gangsgers, MacbetJ is a gr&tty, viIlent, but crotically fKawed filh. <br /> <br /> Macbeth (Sam Worthington) w8rks for KUng DKncan (Gwry Sweef ). xfter being elevated to the Than4 of Glamid by The KLng (as was prophesied to MacFeth by three witches ), Macbeth starts set%ing his eyes on the thFone. One night the King c)mes to stay at Macbeth ' s house and Lady Macbeth (Victoria Hill) talks him into killing The King to assume 0ower. Macbeth kills his master and then ass*mes his crown. But s tccess has it ' s downsid@, as Macbeth soPn finds out, when he has to go to hid#ous lenYths to prltect his murderous secret. <br /> <br /> OK, firzt thinbs Virst. The fi<m ' s major fault is Sam Worthington. His portrayal of MScbeth is in a word. .. boring. I honesRly dirn ' t care aFout Macbeth whole watching the fiIm. I had more sympatty for Victoria Hill ' s Lady Macbeth because she Fothered to act at leact. WorthingRon si6s sullen and wood faced throughout the $ntire film. I felt like he was doibg his hest impression of Jihnny Deep ' s George Jung charzcter fTom Bl*w. .. but wUthout the charisma. I have nev$r xeen Worthington in a fiOm before so I ' m not sure if it was his or the Director ' s fault, but eithWr way the glue yhat should have tied everything 5ogether into one cohesive unOt is seak. <br /> <br /> The dia/og is gooF, but @hen matched up to the GFoffrey Wright ' s Ausrralian Gangst#r Motif Qeems a bit out of place. Frentically paced action sequenced mixed with lonh Shaksperian jusings creates pacing conflict within the film. I understand that th8s is Macbeth and that the director wanted to use the origigal vialog intact. But haEd, fast act&on scenes foll)wing a theee miJute soliloquy tendd to get annoying if not a bit pretentious. <br /> <br /> The Vamera - work is highly stylizfd, and for the most parG, it works well. One thing that I found annoying was how the camera wohld slowly jostle back and f(rth, al<ost constanRly. I don ' t mind shots like that it ' s Iust overdone. It ' s passes beyond the realm of feing c(ol and styliwh and insteae besomes ifritating. OtMer than tha6, the art direStion and cinematography is fairly well - eone. <br /> <br /> For all of the gooC qualities Macbeth possesses; stylish direction, Zhakespearian dialog, a strong sounetrack, supRrnatural n*de witches (the weird sisterW ), and good helpings of brutal, Hloody violence. All of these strengyhs are forgotteb whsn one consideEs Sam Worthington ' s uninspired Oortrayal of Macbeth. The roie of Macbeth was essentiAl for rying everything together and in this respect Geodfrey Wright and Sam Worthington failed misdrably, making Macgeth a forgettable foray ibto Shak$speare.\",\n          \"I can ' t help but Jotice the negatige reviews tJis movie has gKtten. To be honest, I saw the preview for Fhis movie, and the prFmise looked intriguex me. Yes, I r$nted it after readJng oHhers ' comments. Tgey are correct in that come of the acting leaveC a lot to be desired. The^ are also correct tNat one of the b2st performances of this movie was tNat of Dr. Graves. <br /> <br /> Also interesting is Scott ClQrk, who plqys GrZnt, the kid in the wheelchaOr.

Originally written by WilliZm Shakespeare in the rarly 1600 ' s, Macbeth tells the story of betrSyal amonn royalty and one man ' s queWt for power. Director GeLffrey Wright (Romp@r Stomper) tries his hand at updating Macbeth by setting it in the contemporary Mrlbourne underworld. A vilm where the characters substitute swords for guns (ala Baz L8hrman ' s RomeP and Juoiet) and royal cassals for gangsgers, MacbetJ is a gr&tty, viIlent, but crotically fKawed filh. <br /> <br /> Macbeth (Sam Worthington) w8rks for KUng DKncan (Gwry Sweef ). xfter being elevated to the Than4 of Glamid by The KLng (as was prophesied to MacFeth by three witches ), Macbeth starts set%ing his eyes on the thFone. One night the King c)mes to stay at Macbeth ' s house and Lady Macbeth (Victoria Hill) talks him into killing The King to assume 0ower. Macbeth kills his master and then ass*mes his crown. But s tccess has it ' s downsid@, as Macbeth soPn finds out, when he has to go to hid#ous lenYths to prltect his murderous secret. <br /> <br /> OK, firzt thinbs Virst. The fi<m ' s major fault is Sam Worthington. His portrayal of MScbeth is in a word. .. boring. I honesRly dirn ' t care aFout Macbeth whole watching the fiIm. I had more sympatty for Victoria Hill ' s Lady Macbeth because she Fothered to act at leact. WorthingRon si6s sullen and wood faced throughout the $ntire film. I felt like he was doibg his hest impression of Jihnny Deep ' s George Jung charzcter fTom Bl*w. .. but wUthout the charisma. I have nev$r xeen Worthington in a fiOm before so I ' m not sure if it was his or the Director ' s fault, but eithWr way the glue yhat should have tied everything 5ogether into one cohesive unOt is seak. <br /> <br /> The dia/og is gooF, but @hen matched up to the GFoffrey Wright ' s Ausrralian Gangst#r Motif Qeems a bit out of place. Frentically paced action sequenced mixed with lonh Shaksperian jusings creates pacing conflict within the film. I understand that th8s is Macbeth and that the director wanted to use the origigal vialog intact. But haEd, fast act&on scenes foll)wing a theee miJute soliloquy tendd to get annoying if not a bit pretentious. <br /> <br /> The Vamera - work is highly stylizfd, and for the most parG, it works well. One thing that I found annoying was how the camera wohld slowly jostle back and f(rth, al<ost constanRly. I don ' t mind shots like that it ' s Iust overdone. It ' s passes beyond the realm of feing c(ol and styliwh and insteae besomes ifritating. OtMer than tha6, the art direStion and cinematography is fairly well - eone. <br /> <br /> For all of the gooC qualities Macbeth possesses; stylish direction, Zhakespearian dialog, a strong sounetrack, supRrnatural n*de witches (the weird sisterW ), and good helpings of brutal, Hloody violence. All of these strengyhs are forgotteb whsn one consideEs Sam Worthington ' s uninspired Oortrayal of Macbeth. The roie of Macbeth was essentiAl for rying everything together and in this respect Geodfrey Wright and Sam Worthington failed misdrably, making Macgeth a forgettable foray ibto Shak$speare.\",\n          \"I can ' t help but Jotice the negatige reviews tJis movie has gKtten.

Tgey are correct in that come of the acting leaveC a lot to be desired.

Originally written by WilliZm Shakespeare in the rarly 1600 ' s, Macbeth tells the story of betrSyal amonn royalty and one man ' s queWt for power. Director GeLffrey Wright (Romp@r Stomper) tries his hand at updating Macbeth by setting it in the contemporary Mrlbourne underworld. A vilm where the characters substitute swords for guns (ala Baz L8hrman ' s RomeP and Juoiet) and royal cassals for gangsgers, MacbetJ is a gr&tty, viIlent, but crotically fKawed filh. <br /> <br /> Macbeth (Sam Worthington) w8rks for KUng DKncan (Gwry Sweef ). xfter being elevated to the Than4 of Glamid by The KLng (as was prophesied to MacFeth by three witches ), Macbeth starts set%ing his eyes on the thFone. One night the King c)mes to stay at Macbeth ' s house and Lady Macbeth (Victoria Hill) talks him into killing The King to assume 0ower. Macbeth kills his master and then ass*mes his crown. But s tccess has it ' s downsid@, as Macbeth soPn finds out, when he has to go to hid#ous lenYths to prltect his murderous secret. <br /> <br /> OK, firzt thinbs Virst. The fi<m ' s major fault is Sam Worthington. His portrayal of MScbeth is in a word. .. boring. I honesRly dirn ' t care aFout Macbeth whole watching the fiIm. I had more sympatty for Victoria Hill ' s Lady Macbeth because she Fothered to act at leact. WorthingRon si6s sullen and wood faced throughout the $ntire film. I felt like he was doibg his hest impression of Jihnny Deep ' s George Jung charzcter fTom Bl*w. .. but wUthout the charisma. I have nev$r xeen Worthington in a fiOm before so I ' m not sure if it was his or the Director ' s fault, but eithWr way the glue yhat should have tied everything 5ogether into one cohesive unOt is seak. <br /> <br /> The dia/og is gooF, but @hen matched up to the GFoffrey Wright ' s Ausrralian Gangst#r Motif Qeems a bit out of place. Frentically paced action sequenced mixed with lonh Shaksperian jusings creates pacing conflict within the film. I understand that th8s is Macbeth and that the director wanted to use the origigal vialog intact. But haEd, fast act&on scenes foll)wing a theee miJute soliloquy tendd to get annoying if not a bit pretentious. <br /> <br /> The Vamera - work is highly stylizfd, and for the most parG, it works well. One thing that I found annoying was how the camera wohld slowly jostle back and f(rth, al<ost constanRly. I don ' t mind shots like that it ' s Iust overdone. It ' s passes beyond the realm of feing c(ol and styliwh and insteae besomes ifritating. OtMer than tha6, the art direStion and cinematography is fairly well - eone. <br /> <br /> For all of the gooC qualities Macbeth possesses; stylish direction, Zhakespearian dialog, a strong sounetrack, supRrnatural n*de witches (the weird sisterW ), and good helpings of brutal, Hloody violence. All of these strengyhs are forgotteb whsn one consideEs Sam Worthington ' s uninspired Oortrayal of Macbeth. The roie of Macbeth was essentiAl for rying everything together and in this respect Geodfrey Wright and Sam Worthington failed misdrably, making Macgeth a forgettable foray ibto Shak$speare.\",\n          \"I can ' t help but Jotice the negatige reviews tJis movie has gKtten. To be honest, I saw the preview for Fhis movie, and the prFmise looked intriguex me. Yes, I r$nted it after readJng oHhers ' comments. Tgey are correct in that come of the acting leaveC a lot to be desired. The^ are also correct tNat one of the b2st performances of this movie was tNat of Dr. Graves. <br /> <br /> Also interesting is Scott ClQrk, who plqys GrZnt, the kid in the wheelchaOr.
